This script is a simple Windows batch file that does the following:

1. Change your display settup to one screen only.
2. Pretent to encrypt some files in c:\windows
3. Start the petya.html file using Micorosft Edge in kiosk mode (full screen)

It seems to have frozen your computer, but as always you can close the program with Alt+F4.
